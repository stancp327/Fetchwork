# Vercel Deployment Trigger - React Compatibility Fix

This file forces Vercel to deploy the React compatibility fix from PR #12.

## Issue
- PR #12 merged successfully with React 18.2.0 + react-scripts 5.0.1 fix
- Vercel still serving cached JavaScript bundles (main.2111dbc5.chunk.js) 
- AdminDashboard stuck on "Loading..." for 25+ minutes
- Console shows "Admin not authenticated" from old cached code

## Solution
Force fresh Vercel deployment without build cache to serve updated React 18.2.0 bundles.
