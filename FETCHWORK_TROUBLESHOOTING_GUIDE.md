# FetchWork Troubleshooting Guide

## 1. Project Overview

FetchWork is a comprehensive freelance service platform that connects clients with skilled professionals. The platform features secure authentication, role-based access control (admin/user), payment processing, real-time messaging, job management, and comprehensive analytics.

**Tech Stack:**
- **Frontend**: React 18.2.0, deployed on Vercel
- **Backend**: Express.js with Node.js, deployed on Render
- **Database**: MongoDB Atlas
- **Authentication**: JWT with bcrypt password hashing
- **Hosting**: Vercel (frontend), Render (backend)

**Key Features:**
- User registration and authentication
- Admin dashboard with analytics and management tools
- Job posting and browsing system
- Secure payment processing
- Real-time messaging between users
- Review and rating system
- Role-based permissions and access control

---

## 2. Current System State

### ✅ Working Components
- **Backend**: Live and confirmed working at `https://fetchwork-1.onrender.com/test-db`
- **MongoDB**: Connection is healthy and operational
- **JWT Authentication**: Implemented and functional with proper token generation
- **User Registration/Login**: Working endpoints at `/api/auth/register` and `/api/auth/login`
- **Admin/User Roles**: Defined and stored in JWT payload with `isAdmin` boolean flag
- **Security Middleware**: Rate limiting, CORS, and Helmet configured
- **Trust Proxy**: Configured for Render deployment environment

### 🟡 Partially Working Components
- **Frontend**: Deployed via Vercel but experiencing persistent caching issues
- **Admin Dashboard**: Functional but affected by frontend caching problems
- **Vercel CDN**: Continues serving outdated JavaScript bundles despite successful redeployments

### ❌ Known Issues
- Old JavaScript bundle `main.2111dbc5.chunk.js` still served despite new bundle `main.d54b42b3.js` being built
- Admin dashboard occasionally stuck on "Loading..." due to cached frontend code
- Intermittent "Admin not authenticated" errors from cached authentication logic

---

## 3. Issues Encountered

### Frontend Caching Issues
- **Problem**: Vercel CDN/cache continues serving outdated frontend bundles even after successful deploys
- **Impact**: Users see old React code that may have compatibility issues or outdated authentication logic
- **PRs Affected**: #12 (React compatibility fix), #13 (trust proxy fix)
- **Symptoms**: 
  - Browser loads `main.2111dbc5.chunk.js` instead of newer `main.d54b42b3.js`
  - Admin dashboard shows "Loading..." indefinitely
  - Console errors about "Admin not authenticated" from old cached code

### Authentication Middleware Issues
- **Problem**: Admin login fails with "Invalid admin token" despite valid `isAdmin: true` token
- **Impact**: Admin dashboard inaccessible even with correct credentials
- **Root Cause**: Potential inconsistencies in JWT validation logic in `authenticateAdmin` middleware
- **Symptoms**:
  - `/api/auth/me` works correctly
  - `/api/admin/dashboard` returns 401 errors
  - Valid JWT tokens rejected by admin middleware

### Historical Build Failures (Resolved)
- **React Compatibility**: React 19 incompatibility with `react-scripts 3.4.4` (Fixed in PR #12)
- **Trust Proxy**: Missing `app.set('trust proxy', true)` causing Render deployment failures (Fixed in PR #13)
- **Rate Limiting**: Express-rate-limit configuration issues with proxy settings (Resolved)

## 4. Fixes Already Applied

### React Version Compatibility
- **Action**: Downgraded React from 19.0.0 to 18.2.0
- **Action**: Upgraded react-scripts from 3.4.4 to 5.0.1
- **PR**: #12 - Fix React compatibility
- **Status**: Merged and deployed

### Backend Infrastructure
- **Action**: Added `app.set('trust proxy', true)` to server configuration
- **Action**: Configured express-rate-limit for Render proxy environment
- **PR**: #13 - Fix Render runtime error
- **Status**: Merged and deployed

### Authentication System
- **Action**: Implemented comprehensive JWT authentication with user registration/login
- **Action**: Added admin role recognition with `isAdmin` boolean flag in JWT payload
- **Action**: Created `authenticateAdmin` middleware for protected admin routes
- **PR**: #6, #10, #11 - JWT authentication implementation and fixes
- **Status**: All merged

### Frontend Cache Mitigation Attempts
- **Action**: Hard refresh, cache clear, browser restarts performed
- **Action**: Created `.vercel-deploy-trigger-react-fix` file to force fresh deployment
- **Action**: Verified new JavaScript bundle `main.d54b42b3.js` built successfully
- **Status**: Caching issues persist despite successful builds

### Debug Logging
- **Action**: Added comprehensive debug logging to `authenticateAdmin` middleware
- **Action**: Implemented step-by-step JWT validation tracing with emoji-prefixed console logs
- **Status**: Debug logging implemented but needs deployment to Render for testing

## 5. Next Steps

### Immediate Priority: Frontend Caching Resolution
- ⏭️ **Purge Vercel CDN cache** at project or deployment level
- ⏭️ **Verify bundle serving** in DevTools > Network tab to confirm which `.chunk.js` file loads
- ⏭️ **Test alternative domain** `fetchwork-dusky.vercel.app` to bypass potential CDN issues
- ⏭️ **Force unique bundle hash** by modifying build configuration if caching persists
- ⏭️ **Cache-busting URL parameters** like `?cache_bust=1` for testing

### Admin Authentication Debugging
- ⏭️ **Deploy debug logging** to Render service to enable middleware tracing
- ⏭️ **Test admin route directly** via Postman or curl: `POST /api/admin/dashboard`
- ⏭️ **Monitor Render logs** for detailed JWT validation step failures
- ⏭️ **Compare token validation** between `/api/auth/me` (working) and `/api/admin/dashboard` (failing)
- ⏭️ **Add fallback error handling** in `authenticateAdmin` to catch unknown failure points

### Testing Scenarios
- ⏭️ **Valid admin token**: Test with `admin@fetchwork.com` credentials
- ⏭️ **Non-admin token**: Test with regular user credentials
- ⏭️ **Expired token**: Test with old/expired JWT
- ⏭️ **Malformed token**: Test with invalid JWT structure
- ⏭️ **Missing token**: Test without Authorization header

### Code Quality and Monitoring
- ⏭️ **Remove debug logs** after identifying and fixing authentication issues
- ⏭️ **Add proper error handling** for production environment
- ⏭️ **Monitor console logs** for "Invalid admin token" and trace to specific middleware check
- ⏭️ **Update documentation** with final resolution steps
